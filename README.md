# IdlePharmacy
This is a joke. I'm not actually making Idle Games. That would be a waste of time.

Josh made a joke at work about needing an idle game that was pill related. So I made a pharmacy idle game. It's so dumb. It's not even good. BUT, I did it! One night! Less than two and a half hours including graphics. Take that, Josh!
